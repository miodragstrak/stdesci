# DeSci Platform MVP

This is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a decentralized science (DeSci) platform built on the Solana testnet. The goal is to enable open, transparent, and community-driven scientific collaboration using blockchain technology.

## 🔬 Purpose
- Promote open-access and decentralized validation of scientific work
- Provide transparent publication & reward mechanisms
- Build a DAO to manage funding, curation, and incentives

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Vite + React
- Solana (testnet)
- Wallet Adapter
- VS Code
- GitHub for collaboration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/desciplatform.git
cd desciplatform
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Connect to Solana testnet
Add wallet adapter components and configure to connect to Solana testnet.

## 📦 Dependencies
